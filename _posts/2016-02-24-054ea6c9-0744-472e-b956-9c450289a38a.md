Where did the time go?  It seems like just yesterday that I was smitten with a pretty young blonde that I thought was out of my league.  Twenty five years later, I now worry that some clown is going to have those same thoughts about my pretty young blonde.  How did this happen?  What was I thinking?  I'm not prepared for this.  It's been fun for the last thirteen years, but now I'm faced with the reality that she's growing up.  

I'm still smitten with the pretty young blonde that brought my daughter into this world.  I'm sure she's figured out by now that she is "out of my league", but for some crazy reason has decided to stick around.  Someday, it'll just be the two of us again.  I look forward to those days.  What I'm not looking forward to is the day when the other pretty blonde in my life decides to head out on her own and start her own life without her overbearing parents monitoring her every move.  I'm already experiencing it.  Everyday that passes, she takes another step towards independence.
